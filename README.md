# Course-Assignment
A system for students to submit their course preferences for school and automatically, fairly, and quickly allocate classes to maximize total happiness and equity.


### Statement of Intent

I've heard a lot of complaints about the speed, accuracy, and fairness of Nueva's course selection system, so I attempted to model this environment and create a few algorithms for allocating students their desired classes to solve this problem. Each test case has a list of students with certain preferences, which are skewed towards certain popular classes that don't have enough space for all the students who want them, and they submit a request form of their desired classes list, as well as the number of total classes they want. The algorithms then have their own ways of giving priority to certain students or metrics and assign courses one-by-one this way.
